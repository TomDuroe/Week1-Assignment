            Git bash is basic Unix shell, therefore you can list current files and directories with the ls command
            Since it is a Unix shell, you can make an alias called dir in a .bashrc file. It's handy when you are on windows OS.

            A window with a command prompt will open.
            To remove a file simply type in the "del filename" command
            To create a file, simply type in the "touch" command
