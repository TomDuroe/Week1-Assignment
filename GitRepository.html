<h1>What is a Git Repository?</h1>
<p> 
    A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. In essence they are 
    the users project folder. A repository contains all of the project files 
    and stores each file's history. Repositories can be public or private 
    and can even have multiple project collaborators.
